# The Gaming House #

In "The Gaming House" game, you are the manager of a gaming club. The main goal is to reach the Number 1 
Club Position of the Entire World.

### ABOUT THE GAME ###

You will be able to see the different behaviours from the different characters
of the game:

	1) e-Sports Team Members: the players. They will perform different activities inside 
	the house: eating, relaxing, sleeping, training, going to WC and playing at their PC's. 
	Every day, in the afternoon, they must do some training matches under the supervision of the coach. 
	At night, they will go sleep.
	
	2) e-Sports Trainer: he will arrive at the house to supervise the training. After that, 
	he will leave the house.
	
	3) Fans: they will wander around the exterior of the house, and if they are close to it, 
	they will twit a message that you can read through the screen (bottom-right).

### GAME LOOP ###

This game has a Day-Night cycle. The players will perform their activities during the day, and they will go to sleep at night.
They have the Training set at 18:00h: the coach will enter and the 3 training matches will begin.
IF THEY WIN THE MACTH: the team will gain Experience (experience makes the team reach better Ranks: the Rank Bar is placed at the top rigth of the screen).
The Team reputation (placed under the experience bar) will increase/decrease depending on the match: 
if they win, reputation is increased, otherwise, it will decrease.

The fans will appear more often by the day than by the night (and care, because really, really really often they will break into your house).
You can see what time is it in the Time Controller placed at the middle-up side of the screen.

YOU LOSE when you haven't got enough money to pay the salary of your players, so they won't play matches anymore and you will be in Bankrupt.

When you finish the game (Win or Lose), a window will appear to show you your stats: "Days" played, current incomes, team score... So, share with your friends
this info and be the best player!

### RANKS SYSTEM ###

You start at BRONZE RANK, the worse rank.
To achieve the next Rank you will have to win 5 matches, so you will achieve SILVER RANK.
Then, win 10 matches to be at GOLD RANK, the final rank. 
Finally, win 10 matches at GOLD RANK to win the game.

### YOUR INCOMES ###

You start the game with a base income of 10 000$. With this money, you can do multiple actions:
- Build and Upgrade your house.
- Buy/Sell players.
- Pay the salary of your players.

Incomes increase when your players win matches.

### CONSTRUCTION MODE ###

You can upgrade the Gaming House by buying and building new zones: Jacuzzi, Gym, Playroom... 
To enter "Construction Mode", click the CONSTRUCTION button placed at the bottom-left side of the screen.

### MANAGING YOUR PLAYERS ###

You can buy/sell players to increase your global score, making matches easier to win. You can see the stats of the players
with the drop down menu placed at the bottom-left corner of the screen. Through this menu, you can sell your players and see
their statistics more detailed by clicking the info button.

TO BUY NEW PLAYERS: click the "Buy Players" button and you will se a new window, showing three candidates to be bought.
If you want to buy Epic and Legendary players, you have to accomplish certain CONDITIONS. 
These conditions can be:

 - To have a Jacuzzi in the house.
 - To have a Gym.
 - To have a PlayRoom.

Epic players have only one condition (they will demand you only one of these 3 areas to be built).
Legendary players have two conditions to be accomplished (they will demand two of these 3 areas to be built).
Super Legendary players (score 95+) have the three conditions to be accomplished if you want to buy them.

ATTENTION! YOU CAN'T BUY/SELL PLAYERS DURING TRAINING TIME.

(Very rare often, players will perform activities in the different specific place, but don't worry, they are humans like us, 
so they can make mistakes when they are tired).

Each player has a global score that affects the match result (higher the global score of your team = easier to win a match).
Depending on this individual score, players can be "Rare", "Epic", or "Legendary".
